* **Session Abstract**: As programmers we hack everything from our gaming consoles to our home automation systems, but how much time do we spend programming wellness into our lives? In this talk we will cover the fundamentals of nutrition, exercise and what it takes to stay healthy at a desk job. Since we are programmers, and we are lazy, this talk will offer various hacks and shortcuts that have helped the speaker go, with minimal effort, from an overweight couch potato to a fit and active health enthusiast. Learn to program a few minor changes to your daily routine and observe a healthier version of yourself make its way into production. Once you have your health under control you will have more energy, feel happier, have a sharper mind and consequently deliver better code. If you are unsatisfied with your “programmers physique” and want to leave CodeMash with something practical you can start using on Monday, then check out this talk.
