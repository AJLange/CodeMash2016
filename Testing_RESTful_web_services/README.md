### Mark Winteringham - @2bittester
## Abstract

Testing RESTful Web services RESTful software architecture is becoming more and more popular as a choice for applications and this poses new and interesting challenges and opportunities for Testers. The RESTful Web services training gives attendees the knowledge to rapidly learn and test RESTful web services in both an exploratory and automated capacity. The workshop is interactive using bespoke services built specifically for the workshop that give participants the chance to try out the skills they are being taught in a safe and relevant environment. In addition to the primary goal of the training the workshops give attendees knowledge of a building block of the Web, that can be leveraged for both exploratory and automated testing. 

Testing RESTful Web services Understanding and testing RESTful Web services is an interactive workshop that guides participants through the fundamentals of what makes a Web service RESTful and how to build requests to query and manipulate data from a web service. The attendees will learn key skills through testing a bespoke web service, learning how the service and requests work, and discovering and reporting bugs. 

### Key Topics: 
* What is a Web service and what makes it RESTful? 
* Understanding API and API documentation 
* How to build requests to query and manipulate data from a RESTful Web service 
* Test design techniques for testing against REST
