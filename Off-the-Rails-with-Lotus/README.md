## ABSTRACT

If you are building a web application with Ruby, you don’t always have to turn to Rails. Rails is still prevalent but it’s heavy with lots of hidden complexities and monkey patching. Lotus is a fresh take on building web applications. It is made up of many libraries that can stand on their own. With Lotus, you can have a nice web framework and fast tests since it’s made up of loads of lightweight objects. If you want to learn about another web framework’s take on a web framework, it may be time for you to get off the Rails.

## SLIDES

A PDF version of the slides is in the repo at [off-the-rails-with-lotus/slides.pdf](off-the-rails-with-lotus/slides.pdf). They won't make much sense because, well, gifs were used. A better place to checkout Lotus would be at [http://lotusrb.org](http://lotusrb.org).

## CODE

We built a sample application using Lotus which you can find at [http://github.com/jwright/magpie-lotus](http://github.com/jwright/magpie-lotus).
