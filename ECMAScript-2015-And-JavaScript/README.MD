My slides (built in Reveal.js) are available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/jaredfaris/ES6-talk). They are also online (the AJAX stuff won't work) [here](http://es6talk.azurewebsites.net/). 

The server side of the talk is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/jaredfaris/ES6-server).

My blog is at [http://jaredthenerd.com](http://jaredthenerd.com) and you can find me on Twitter [@JaredTheNerd](http://twitter.com/jaredthenerd).
